## Main Scope

‚ö†Ô∏è Wait! <br>
Yeah... I know our app isn't done yet, but if you want to get a sneak peek of how it's going to be, here's our <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/2E8zbPltLBHhaYk8PHVWk7/HerWalk?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=ClA8WRryGOCnrrHI-1">Figma</a> project!

Now you are ready to read our briefing.

<br>
HerWalk App <br>
The app we are envisioning has the main purpose of taking the travel experience for female travelers to a whole new level. To achieve this, we will rely on the app's female community, which will be able to advertise their spaces for accommodation to other women. It's like an Airbnb specifically geared towards the female audience, but with the option of shared rooms, private rooms, houses, campsites, and much more, providing safety for solo female travelers, groups, and those traveling with children. Our app aims to encourage women to travel more and have incredible experiences on their own, regardless of their age. We will provide information about the safety of each location, which will be contributed by the app's female users aged 18 and above who are also travelers. Additionally, we hope to build a real communication network among users from around the world who are in the same location/destination and have chosen the "make new friends" option in their app profiles.

In another tab, our app will have a map with information about the location, including nearby establishments (highlighting those owned by women who choose to advertise on our app), nearby Wi-Fi availability, required documentation (visas, vaccinations, etc.), local safety level, regional events and activities (such as lectures and markets), weather information, general clothing tips based on the climate, currency conversion, exchange offices, and information about transportation (such as nearby mechanics, gas stations, etc.), as well as emergency services.

In fact, besides offering accommodation sales, we can also provide additional services such as promoting and highlighting local female entrepreneurs on the app at a lower cost compared to larger establishments owned by other entrepreneurs, who can also have enhanced visibility at a slightly higher cost. Connecting cultures and women is at the core of our app, always prioritizing safety by providing location-specific information and fostering a strong support network within the app's own female community as a foundation.
